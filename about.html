    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>SettleUp can handle a variety of payment scenarios: When one person pays or multiple people have paid, it can split payments evenly based on the amounts or allow you to select individual amounts for each person to pay. The share function allows you to send expenses via e-mail, social media, WhatsApp or any other channel. Expenses are backed up and synced for all people in the group so each person can see them.

            If you’re traveling internationally, SettleUp can add the day’s local exchange rate to the transaction and even stores historical exchange rates just in case you change the date. You can also set a fixed exchange to be applied to all purchases. The free version of the app will display ads occasionally, which can get annoying if you’re a heavy user. The premium version of the app doesn’t display ads, allows you to add photos of receipts and allows you to customize groups with color.</p>
